## How To Play

As the API does not have a UI/Frontend to play with, but for the sake of testing the API, the following steps could be taken

After the code is running on the system or the online link is being used(shared in Readme file)

Please use a tool like [postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) as the Server Request done here are using POST method

check the [sample request json file](https://github.com/adityaseth09/php-tictactoe/docs/blob/master/sampleRequest.json) And the [sample response json](https://github.com/adityaseth09/php-tictactoe/docs/blob/master/sampleResponse.json)
 
The API is completely stateless, so the game could be started at any point.
